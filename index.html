    <h2>First Impressions</h2>
    <p>So, I stumbled upon this nifty drawing site and the first thing I noticed was the quirky way it uses patterns for colors. No fancy rainbow stuff, just black and white patterns.</p>

    <h2>What I Did</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Drew a funky-looking circular thingy using the circle tool.</li>
        <li>Switched to the square tool and made a pattern of squares that looked like a puzzle.</li>
        <li>Played around with different patterns, adding some cool texture to my drawings.</li>
        <li>Zoomed in, moved the canvas around, and adjusting details!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I Enjoyed Most</h2>
    <p>
        I really like the layout of its toolbar, it takes up very little website page space, and the tools are not folded, so I can quickly find the tools I need.
    </p>

    <h2>What's the Point Anyway?</h2>
    <p>
        It allows you to build your favorite paintings in white and black, unlike ordinary colorful drawing tools. Drawing with black and white requires focusing on the outline structure of the drawing, outlining details with outlines, rather than matching colors.
    </p>

    <h2>How They Explain It</h2>
    <p>
        When drawing, the outline is crucial, and using this black and white drawing board allows us to focus on the practice of drawing the outline.
    </p>

    <h2>How Long Should  Hang Around?</h2>
    <p>

        This depends on the complexity of the painting, using black and white drawing boards can overlook the details of the colors and save a lot of time. I used it to draw a star and moon, all I need to do is draw the outline.
    </p>
    <h2>How They Nudge You</h2>
    <p>The site's super chill about it. You doodle whenever you want, however you want. It's like a digital sketchbook.</p>

    <h2>What's the Connection to Other Art?</h2>
    <p>It feels like a nod to that artsy minimalism trend. Less is more, they say.</p>

    <h2>What's the Vibe?</h2>
    <p>
        Black and white look very serious, and this atmosphere can make you a bit nervous, which to some extent makes me more focused on painting. In addition, the drawing board is very large, most of which are drawing boards, which will make me more focused on painting.
    </p>

    <h2>What Got on My Nerves</h2>
    <p>
        The black and white interface makes me a bit nervous. Because I think the colorful interface will make me relax a bit.

    </p>
    <h2>What Made Me Grin</h2>
    <p>Seeing my pattern-filled creations coming to life was like a tiny victory each time. So satisfying!</p>
